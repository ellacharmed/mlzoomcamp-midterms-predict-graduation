    I'm Ella :sagittarius: and delighted to make your acquataince. 
    
    Well, actually Ella is my nickname because my real name is quite a mouthful and when we were all little, my younger cousins (I was the *first* grandchild) couldn't pronounce the 'z' from Zila, so one of them dubbed me "Ella" and it stuck. My full name is actually Sahzilawati.
    
    I got into coding because I've always dug into code when playing games. Some of you who has played The Sims 3, might recognized my social persona 'ellacharmed' from [the world fixes](https://ellacharmed.wordpress.com/category/world-fixes-2/) I made for that game.
    
    I've since dabbled in Unity 3D modding a few years back, during the pandemic, and released a few mods for the game [Surviving the Aftermath](https://steamcommunity.com/app/684450). You can find my mods on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ellacharmed/myworkshopfiles/?appid=684450).
    
    And now I got the Data-bug - everything is coming up data! I've just started my Data Science studies in the past year, it's been a year of interesting projects and community building with fellow learners.
